# New York City TLC Trip Record Capstone
New York City's (NYC) Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) fills in the gaps left by the city's public transit networks, serving as an essential link. A taxi can readily service routes and locations that buses or trains may not be able to. This makes it the perfect option for people who live in suburban areas or other less accessible areas because it provides a smooth link to a variety of locations without the inconvenience of transfers or complicated routing. We will analyze NYC TLC data as part of the Purwadhika Capstone Project in order to identify issues and possible solutions. The data is taken from https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page.
