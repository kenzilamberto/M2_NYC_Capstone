# New York City TLC Trip Record Capstone
New York City's (NYC) Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) fills in the gaps left by the city's public transit networks, serving as an essential link. A taxi can readily service routes and locations that buses or trains may not be able to. This makes it the perfect option for people who live in suburban areas or other less accessible areas because it provides a smooth link to a variety of locations without the inconvenience of transfers or complicated routing. We will analyze NYC TLC data as part of the Purwadhika Capstone Project in order to identify issues and possible solutions. The data is taken from https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page.

# Problem Statement
In today's world of fierce digital competition, increasing the profitability of taxi services through analysis of consumer behavior and preference is a challenging task. A solid understanding of operational dynamics and customer service is essential to successfully navigate this difficulty. Through more in-depth exploration of particular facets of taxi operations, we may identify more focused and precise solutions. 

To maximize operations and boost profitability in the taxi sector, it is critical to comprehend client demand patterns, local preferences, and elements that impact customer happiness (like tips). Businesses can make better judgments about pricing, resource allocation, and customer service efforts by assessing what motivates customers to express extra gratitude and when and where services are most required. These are the following problems that we want to anaylze:
1. taxi demand;
2. revenue; and
3. tips for driver.
